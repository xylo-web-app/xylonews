        The pen tapping hype was brought to school by Hillol. After the begining of the hype, everybody is learning it and singing songs. But many people play it wrong. So, Hillol made a group called Pen Crackers and made pen tapping more stricter. People on the group can officially play it, but if any other people plays, it is not valid. To join the group, contact to Hillol in tifin period and learn how to do pen tapping like a pro, get a free modified pen suited for pen tapping and also do pen tapping in a valid manner.

      <div class="message-title">‚ùÑÔ∏è Know more about Air Conditioners that keep you cool during this scorching heat - By Hillol</div>
      <div class="message-content">
        Air conditioning, often abbreviated as A/C (US) or air con (UK), is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior temperature and, in some cases, controlling the humidity of internal air. Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or through other methods, such as passive cooling and ventilative cooling. Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Heat pumps are similar in many ways to air conditioners but use a reversing valve, allowing them to both heat and cool an enclosed space. Air conditioners, which typically use vapor-compression refrigeration, range in size from small units used in vehicles or single rooms to massive units that can cool large buildings. Air source heat pumps, which can be used for heating as well as cooling, are becoming increasingly common in cooler climates.

Air conditioners can reduce mortality rates due to higher temperature. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) 1.6 billion air conditioning units were used globally in 2016. The United Nations called for the technology to be made more sustainable to mitigate climate change and for the use of alternatives, like passive cooling, evaporative cooling, selective shading, windcatchers, and better thermal insulation.
